    <h4>Here are some interesting Facts about Jenny!</h4>
    <ol>
        <hr>
      <li><b>if she had to choose between saving my life or scoffing down a jar of peanut butter, no shot, she'd merk that jar!</b><br>
      hah, i don't blame her, i'd do the same if it weren't for this Frontal lobe of mine! darned reasoning getting in the way of my impulsive urge to teamwipe the condiment aisle, am i right?
        <hr>
      <li><b>She Plays The Piano</b><br>hey man, you just gotta trust me on this one, she does it all, chopin, bethoven, even bill evans! She's actually gained a following by posting piano covers on youtube, she is infact a professional at this point and I piggyback off of her success by living off of the money she makes, you know, like how they did it with another well known artist with a name that rhymes with kritney nears.</li>
        <hr>
      <li><b>She ponders over the futility of chasing her tail</b><br>"Will i ever catch it? will i be happy if i do?"you know, she's told me, in plain english no less.</li>
